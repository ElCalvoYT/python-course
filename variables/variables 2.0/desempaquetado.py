# Unpackaging data.

# Create a tuple with the name and surname of the person.
data = ("Juansi", "Ibarra Podhajecki")

# Declare a variable with the name and surname of the person at the same time.
nombre, apellido = data

#! This only works if the quantity of elements in the tuple,
#! is the same the quantity of variables we create.
